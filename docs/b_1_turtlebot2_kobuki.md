# Kobuki Base

Kobuki is an mobile base for open-source research and development purposes. It can be used to quickly and cheaply build research platforms and also provides access to other open source software, including ROS. The result is a product that can very easily utilise existing 3D sensing technologies and navigation algorithms to develop applications for research.
